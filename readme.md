# perfect-codemirror
*A guide to good looking browser editing*

The `codemirror-modded` files are hand concatenated scripts and styles which extend the
original `lib/codemirror` files for ease. They defaultly set `indentWithTabs` to false
and use a special patch to create a nicer cursor blinking effect based on sublime text.

I do not necessarily recommend these scripts for others to use unless you are familiar
with CodeMirror and feel comfortable using them.

You should however, emulate the code found in the main webpage [index.jade](./index.jade),
but as the modded files and index2 stand, they are purely copy and pastable quick resources.
